thing to fix:

1.  use the google ai studio new generative ai of gemini 2.0, an example snippet is like this:

const { GoogleGenerativeAI } = require("@google/generative-ai");

const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI("YOUR_API_KEY");
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-2.0-flash" });

const prompt = "Explain how AI works";

const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
console.log(result.response.text());

2. find me all the content you wrote in the codes, I'm thinking about documenting them, and manage them with some standalone file to better manage things

3. there is one file you were still "Generating", finish that file
